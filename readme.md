# Hi, I'm Brian Emory
But you probably already knew that since you're on my website. You can find me all over @thebrianemory. I am an Elixir software engineer residing in the Phoenix area. I got my start in programming when I stumbled upon a click-baity post on Facebook from [Business Insider](https://web.archive.org/web/20171024211312/http://www.businessinsider.com/learn-how-to-code-2015-5) about a Ruby on Rails course.

When I realized programming is what I wanted to do, I attended an online Ruby on Rails bootcamp. I have since taught myself Elixir and while I have written both professionally, my joy resides with writing Elixir. (Fun fact: this site as well as my projects below are written using Elixir's Phoenix LiveView.)

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thebrianemory) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/thebrianemory.com). I look forward to hearing from you!
